<h1>Day 4 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</h1>
<p>For the Day 4 challenge, I created a Rock, Paper and Scissors game. This is a culmination of the teaching points that were shared in the tutorial, including the following but not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>list and nested list</li>
  <li>random module</li>
  <li>conditional if, elif and else statements</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>I have learned python before in school but I hope to revisit some of the python concepts that I may have forgotten and at the same time delve further into python, especially in the field of data science and visualisation.</p>

<h2>You can join me too!</h2>
